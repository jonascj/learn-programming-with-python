Learning Programming With Python
================================

This is a personal project to write a small tutorial and reference book
for various Python teaching activities.

At the moment it is written in Danish, because my current target group
are Danish high-school students.

It is however intended as a general introduction to programming and Python, 
along with varioius other technical topics pertaining to programming. 

So it is my intention to translate it to English.
At the moment you could say I am translating it from English to Danish.
It is much easier to write techinical texts in English
because so many technical terms are being coined first in English.


Cross-platform and open source
==============================

The aim is to only use open source and cross-platform (Linux, macOS and Windows)
components in the book (editors, interpreters, other tools).

I am personally very fond of Linux for all tasks,
except playing games distributed for Windows,
but I understand that Linux isn't for everyone.
So I'm trying to write for all three major platforms.

In theory only the initial installation and setup of development environment
should be platform dependent.
Afterwards Python should be platform independent (for most basic tasks).

The book itself is also meant to be open source,
written in reStructured text for Sphinx (http://www.sphinx-doc.org/).



Build the docs
==============

To build the docs on Linux
(but it should be very similar on Windows and macOS)
do the following:

1. git clone https://github.com/jonascj/learn-programming-with-python

2. cd learn-programming-with-python

3. python3 -m venv venv

4. pip install -r reqs.txt

5. source venv/bin/activate

6. make html

View the html output by opening ``_build/html/index.html``
in your favorite (hopefully open source and cross-platform) browser.


Hosted builds
=============
At any moment the current version will be hosted at 
https://l√¶rpython.dk and https://laerpython.dk.


How to contribute
=================

I willl happily accept contributions of writing or other material for the book.

The goal is to make it easy to contribute, especialy for the users of the book,
and GitHub already makes it easy to report issues.

Already there is a lot of text, URLs and screenshots to keep in sync,
and whom better to help keeping them up to date than the users.
